# Connor McDermott's Blog

A blog for me to get some of my ideas and experiences out there. This is a Jekyll-based blog, using the [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/) theme.

## Where to see it
[loligator.github.io/blog](https://loligator.github.io/blog)

## What to expect
I'll be writing on topics that I find interesting, such as Game Dev, Gaming, Linux, or any combination of the two. I'll be avoiding politics or any other hot topics. However, I am a relatively privacy conscious person, so I might sneak some of that in if I feel the need.

## Where else can you see me
My portfolio is also available at [connormcdermott.me](https://connormcdermott.me). Designed on Wix by the lovely Nikita Kumar, who can also be found at [ux.nikitakumar.me](https://ux.nikitakumar.me)!
